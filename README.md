# Real-Time-Chat-Application-using-python
ðŸš€ For this project, I developed a simple command-line chat application in Python that enables real-time message exchange between connected clients, demonstrating a basic implementation of client-server communication. ðŸ’¬ðŸ’»

ðŸ”‘ Project Highlights:
Networking with Python's socket library: Used socket to handle real-time communication, enabling clients to connect to a central server and exchange messages seamlessly.
Multithreading with threading: Employed Python's threading module to handle multiple clients simultaneously, creating a smooth chat experience where each client can independently send and receive messages.
Client-Server Model: Designed the application using a simple client-server architecture, where multiple clients can connect to the server, choose a nickname, and start chatting in real-time.
This project was an exciting dive into the fundamentals of networking in Python, including managing client connections, handling data exchange, and coordinating multiple users in a chat room environment.

ðŸ’¡ Key Packages Used:

socket: For creating connections between clients and the server.
threading: To allow concurrent message handling from multiple users.
Thank you to Oasis Infobyte for providing this opportunity to explore the fundamentals of networking and multithreading in Python!

Next step: Bringing advanced features and GUI interfaces into similar applications. Excited for what's ahead! ðŸš€âœ¨
